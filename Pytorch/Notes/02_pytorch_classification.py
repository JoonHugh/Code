3 types of classificaiton
1. Binary classification (1 or 0)
2. Multiclass classification (steak, fish, bread, etc.)
3. Multi label classifcation (one thing can be classified as multiple things)

What we're going to cover
* Architecture of a neural network classification model
* Input shapes and output shapes of a classification model (features and labels)
* Creating custom data to view, fit on and predict on
* steps in modelling
    * Creating a model, setting a loss function and optimizer, creating a training loop, evaluating a model
* Saving and loading models
* Harnessing the power of non-linearity
* Different classification evaluation models
